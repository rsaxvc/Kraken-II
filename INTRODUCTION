Kraken-II: A small virtual machine.

Long ago, in the age of state-collegiate education, I had a class with Ted McCracken.
I knew this class was going to be hard when on the first day, he announced we would
be designing a computer. Specifically, a small 8-bit RISC machine. Actually, that
didn't seem hard at all. The hard part was that he wanted it in two weeks. By some
strange chance one of the best teachers at the school was having his course
reviewed by the state. This terrible maelstrom yielded my semester of CpE315.

The machine was done piecemeal - each student was given a few parts of the design,
and the basic design was completed. The next part of the course was programming
the system.

Some of the rest of CpE315 involved programming the machine we had designed
piecemeal in class. Dr McCracken graded by stepping through the programs. I would
often make a simple bit-error when assembling the code. After a few weak assignments,
I wrote a small virtual-machine and assembler.

Years later, and a few OS-installs too, I've lost the code to the original 'Kraken'
architecture emulator. So this is a new simple architecture.
